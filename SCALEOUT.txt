CSS Properties

Here's a list of all properties that I think are absolutely essential to knowing CSS. The equivalent of knowing the most basic verbs and nouns in English that you can get by with.

The minimum to be able to do anything:

    padding, margin, border
    background
    color, font-family, font-weight, font-size, line-height
    width, height, max-width, max-height

Layout essentials:

    position, z-index, top, right, bottom, left
    display, flex, align-items, justify-content
    @media

Good to know, but not quite as essential as the rest:

    grid, grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows
    transform, transition

We'll go into these more in a moment. Now we should have enough of the basics down to discuss some applications of the knowledge.
